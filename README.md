# booktoread
This is my sample project which allows me to play around with AngularJs

This project is something I build as I learn AngularJS through self study. This is a project under development. The 
project would allow users to enter a list of interesting reads and later they can get suggestions for a book to read based 
on the user's mood at that moment.
